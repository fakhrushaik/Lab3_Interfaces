Rough Draft of “Cell phones, Teens and Mental Health”

In his article “Cell phones, Teens and Mental Health,” published in The Montreal Gazette, the author Christopher Labos looks at teens’ great utilization of cellphones and social media for both their positive effects and possible drawbacks. While Labos recognizes that technology has enhanced communication and access to information, he is concerned about the potential damage it can have on mental health. Even though teens are typically the first to adopt any new technology, Labos talks about how they are becoming less interested in social media and how many of them are expressing mixed or negative opinions about its effects. An American study highlights that teens who use social media obsessively face a greater chance of developing mental health issues including anxiety and depression. Another study conducted in England found that youngsters who use social media excessively had greater levels of anxiety, lower life satisfaction, and psychological distress—with the effects being more prominent in females than in males. The three major causes of these effects that Labos points out are the decline in physical activities, loss of sleep, and cyberbullying. According to Labos, these factors have only increased the mental health problems faced by today’s teenagers. Despite acknowledging the benefits of technology, Labos argues that in order to mitigate its adverse impacts on mental health, it must be properly managed. On conclusion, Labos calls for a more reflective use of technology and asks people to recreate the connections with a view to improving human relations and personal health. According to him, all it takes is to reduce screen time and encourage a healthy lifestyle to reduce the adverse effects of social media on teens’ mental health.
